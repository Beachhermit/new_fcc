    /*I wasn't expecting to be able to do this. I get valid sequences and it's accepted by the tester
    but the description stipulates the sequence with largest numbers, which this doesn't give because
    if it hits a dead-end, it can't backtrack and try another path. eg Decompose 44 starts with 43
    then tries 9, but it can't finish with 9, so it discards 44 and tries 43. I need to work out how 
    to get it to discard the 9, or whichever is the last number it put in when it failed.

    of the squares is equal to nÂ².*/
