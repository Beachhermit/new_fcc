function confirmEnding(str, target) {

  //freeCodeCamp challenge. Tests a string to see if it ends in a given test string. Not allowed to use .endswith()


  let innards = target + "$"
;
  let re = new RegExp(innards);

  return re.test(str);


}



//completely different to how I solved it last time

//last time I made a substring of the final target.length chars and compared it to target

//Here I've learned how to use a variable in a regex



console.log(confirmEnding("Bastian", "n"));
